# Mogoroom-Demo

Architected using [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel), use [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa) for communication between different layers.

## Usage

In my design, every cell has a accompanied *model*, *viewModel* and *api* class. View *DemoCell1* related classes for an example of adding a new cell.
